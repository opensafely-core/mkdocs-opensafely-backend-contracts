# flake8>=4 requires importlib-metadata<4.3 on python3.8 or lower.
# Markdown>=3.3.5 requires importlib-metadata>=4.4.  Both projects have their
# reaons for these requirements, but we live in a world where pip has a
# resolver now so we're pinning flake8 to 3.x until they lift their upper bound
# on importlib-metadata.
